# AL Buildnumber++ README

To be honest this extension was created, cause i got tired of changing the Build manually.

I had a few times struggles while uploading AL - Extensions to Business Central. 

Every time I've updated the Version it was better. 

So I decided to create a small extension to do it before packaging and publishing the Apps.

## Features

If you use the Command (or keyboard shortcut) "abpp.IncreaseAndRun" (STRG + F8 | CMD + F8) the extension

will search for all app.json files in your workspace and will Increase the Build of the Version.

If this app.json is saved we will run the Commands "al.package" and "al.publish".

## Requirements

Actually we don't have any requirements!

## Extension Settings

Settings should come in the next release. 

I think about having the possibility to setup which number in the version should be increased.

## Known Issues

!!Actually we don't have a functional test!!

This is our first VS Code extension, please help us getting better! 

So we would be happy if you contribute!

## Release Notes

### 0.5.0

Initial release to be able to test this extension.
